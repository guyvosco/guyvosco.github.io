# Guy Vosco

Welcome to my page. My name is Guy, and I am a PhD student in the [Refaely-Abramson Group](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/MCMS/Sivan/home) at the Weizmann Institute of Science.

My research explores the interaction between light and matter in *low-dimensional materials*, examining how these materials absorb and emit light, and how their fundamental properties influence applications such as efficient solar cells and advanced quantum devices.
I use *ab-initio* computational methods including **GW**, **Bethe–Salpeter Equation (BSE)**, and **Density-Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT)** to study how *excitons* (bound electron–hole pairs) and *phonons* (quantized vibrations of the crystal lattice) affect the optical and electronic behavior of materials.
